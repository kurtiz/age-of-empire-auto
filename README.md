# Age of Empire
[![wakatime](https://wakatime.com/badge/github/kurtiz/age-of-empire-auto.svg)](https://wakatime.com/badge/github/kurtiz/age-of-empire-auto)

A simple program to launch and automatically enter the license/activation 
code for Age Of Empire III to play the game.

## Future Features
I'm hoping to add a cheat engine to the program to automatically run or 
enter cheat code during gameplay with defined shortcuts
